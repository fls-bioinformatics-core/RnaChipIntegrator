Installing RnaChipIntegrator
============================

You can use Python's setuptools to install the RnaChipIntegrator code: download the
archive (either .tar.gz or .zip), unpack it and then do:

    python setup.py install

in the unpacked directory.

Alternatively if you're using pip to manage your Python installations then you can do

    pip install RnaChipIntegrator.tar.gz

You can also use pip to install directly from github using

    pip install -e git+git@github.com:fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator#egg=RnaChipIntegrator

or to get a specific version:

   pip install -e git+git@github.com:fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator@v0.3.1#egg=RnaChipIntegrator

Any of these will make the `RnaChipIntegrator` command available to run the program.

If you don't want to do a system install then you can just unpack the archive and run
the program directory using

   /path/to/RnaChipIntegrator.py [options] ...

(Note that in this case if you would like spreadsheet output from the program then you
will need to install the `xlwt`, `xlrd` and `xlutils` third-party Python libraries.)
