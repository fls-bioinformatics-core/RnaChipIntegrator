Installing RnaChipIntegrator
============================

1. You can use Python's setuptools to install the RnaChipIntegrator code. To do this, download the
archive (either .tar.gz or .zip), unpack it and install as follows:

	$ wget https://github.com/downloads/fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator/RnaChipIntegrator-0.3.2.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvzf RnaChipIntegrator-0.3.2.tar.gz
    $ cd RnaChipIntegrator-0.3.2
    $ python setup.py install

2. Alternatively if you're using pip (see http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html) to manage your Python installations then you can install as follows:

	$ wget https://github.com/downloads/fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator/RnaChipIntegrator-0.3.2.tar.gz
    $ pip install RnaChipIntegrator-0.3.2.tar.gz

You can also use pip to install directly from github as follows:

    $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator#egg=RnaChipIntegrator

or to get install specific version:

    $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator@v0.3.1#egg=RnaChipIntegrator

Any of these options will make the `RnaChipIntegrator` utility available to run.

Note: If you don't want to do a system install then you can just unpack the archive and run the program directly:

   /path/to/RnaChipIntegrator.py [options] ...

(Note that in this case if you would like spreadsheet output from the program then you
will need to install the `xlwt`, `xlrd` and `xlutils` third-party Python libraries.)
