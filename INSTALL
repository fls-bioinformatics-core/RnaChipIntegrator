Installing RnaChipIntegrator
============================

You can use Python's setuptools to install the RnaChipIntegrator code: unpack the
archive and then do:

    python setup.py install

in the unpacked directory.

Alternatively if you're using pip to manage your Python installations then you can do

    pip install RnaChipIntegrator.tar.gz

Either of these will make the `RnaChipIntegrator` command available to run the program.

If you don't want to do a system install then you can just unpack the archive and run
the program directory using

   /path/to/RnaChipIntegrator.py [options] ...

(Note that in this case if you would like spreadsheet output from the program then you
will need to install the `xlwt`, `xlrd` and `xlutils` third-party Python libraries.)
