RnaChipIntegrator: analyse 'genes' and 'peaks'
==============================================

``RnaChipIntegrator`` is a Python bioinformatics utility that performs
integrated analyses of 'gene' data (a set of genes or genomic features,
for example gene expression data or canonical gene lists) with 'peak' data
(a set of regions, for example ChIP peaks) to identify the nearest
features to each peak, and vice versa.
