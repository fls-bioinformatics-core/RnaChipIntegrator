RnaChipIntegrator
=================

``RnaChipIntegrator`` is a Python bioinformatics utility that performs
integrated analyses of 'feature' data (any set of genomic features, for
example gene expression data or canonical gene lists) with 'peak' data
(a set of regions, for example ChIP peaks) to identify the nearest
features to each peak, and vice versa.
