Getting started
===============

The source code for ``RnaChipIntegrator`` can be obtained from
https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator/releases

It's recommended to download either a ``tar.gz`` or ``zip`` archive,
unpack and then install using ``pip``, for example by running::

    pip install .

from within the top-level source directory to install the package.

To use the package without installing it first you will need to add the
directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment.

Alternatively you can install the latest version directly from github
using ``pip``::

    pip install git+https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/RnaChipIntegrator.git

(Note that ``git`` needs to be installed for this to work.)

The program needs the following additional Python libraries:

- ``xlrd``
- ``xlrd``
- ``xlutils``

If using ``pip`` these should be installed automatically.
